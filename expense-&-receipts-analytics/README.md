## Benchmarks

The Models view presents comparative rankings and charts from the shared model catalog in [benchmarkModels.ts](src/components/benchmarks/data/benchmarkModels.ts), which also supplies the model details and leaderboard. The evaluation catalog uses each evaluation record as the source for its card and skill, domain, and attribute filters. Benchmark data and presentation live in [src/components/benchmarks/](src/components/benchmarks/).
